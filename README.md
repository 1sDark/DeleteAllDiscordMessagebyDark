About running code on your console
I don't recommend running code from random places you get on the internet. For that same reason, I deliberately choose to make it readable (that's why it is a bit lenthy). That way people can analyze it and understand what does it does before running it, and be sure that nothing sketchy is happening under the hood.

DO NOT SHARE YOUR authToken!
Sharing your authToken on the internet will give full access to your account! There are bots gathering credentials all over the internet. If you post your token by accident, LOGOUT from discord on that same browser you got that token imediately. Changing your password will make sure that you get logged out of every device. I advice that you turn on 2FA afterwards.

If you are unsure do not share screenshots, or copy paste logs on the internet.
